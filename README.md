# Automated-Louver-Project
The purpose is to create a mechatronic system that reads the humidity in the duct and adjusts the position of the vent accordingly.
If the air in the duct is very humid, then we want the louver to be open to expel the humid air.
IF the air is not humid, then we want the louver closed so that air can re-circulate.
